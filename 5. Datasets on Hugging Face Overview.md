dataset viewer is available. we will learn how to leverage opensource python packages and modules in huggingface (like datasets,transformers,diffusers) and make the most use of 
 opensource models.

transformers are most commonly used for texts. transformers can help in building pipelines. 

text to image models
```

```
you can train this model, you can deploy it and you can use that model in Diffusers. in diffusion based models, you can setup a diffusion pipeline.


use library like diffusers, transformers, datasets in python and connect that to hugging-face , so that you can leverage opensource machinelearning resources.
