we get vector representation of each token. token is ran through an embedding layer and vector representations 
of each token is returned.

creating these embeddings and training an embedding encoder is large part of LLM training process. 


being able to train a model from sentence to words to tokens to embedding is a huge part of how LLM builds an 
understanding of the projection of the world from text data. 
Once the model is trained, we can easily go from natural languagetext to tokens to vector embeddings. 
vector embeddings have mathematical representation for each token. 

transformer model will guess the next word which shows up.

topk and topP is to limit the number of tokens you are looking at.
