the git repo on github are mainly focussed on actual code that is used for training , finetuning, running the application.

the git repo in hugging face is focussed on hosting the model itself. 

`.ckpt` files are checkpoint files which are large files that are hosting different parts of the model. 

`spaces` - attaching compute to the models already hosted in hugging face. This is one main selling point of huggingface website. it costs money to add a space to a model.
you can view the spaces attached to the model. `spaces` uses opensource libraries and uses gradio to create GUI. 

you can use `spaces` to explore and play around with the model without needing to download the model.
